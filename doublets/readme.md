Important:

1 const char ** str, for 2 demision array , how to access elements and specific character in each elements

2 trick: for function which used in main.cpp with less parameter, we can add more parameters to it in the header file with those added parameters to have defalut value, e.g 0. But in the implemantation file, we can set it as an parameter. Thus when we use function in a recursive way, we can input other parameters in the function without changing calling in the main function.

3.if we new an array, char* temp = new char[length]. we need to delete it in the end. Using: delete [] temp
